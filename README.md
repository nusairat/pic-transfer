# File Find and Move

I by accidentally wiped one of my external drives that had quite a bit of my pictures on it last year.

So I recovered it but it produced a ton of files and I wasn't sure what to take.

I realized all the files I needed were from my Sony and Canon Camera.

So this app iterates through directories, checks certain files types first, then analyzes the EXIF to see if the make is Sony or Canon, then moves the file.

In theory I should have also put a date range on it but didn't.

I also hard coded hte paths, since I didn't care.
